# Docker Build Fix Documentation

## Issue Description

The local development environment was failing to build due to an issue with the `blog_tester` binary target in the Cargo.toml file. The error occurred during the pre-build step in Dockerfile.local, where the build process was trying to compile all binary targets defined in Cargo.toml but couldn't find the source files.

## Root Causes

1. **Missing Placeholder Files**: The Dockerfile.local was creating a placeholder for the main.rs file but not for the binary targets defined in Cargo.toml.

2. **Multiple Binary Targets**: The Cargo.toml file defines three binary targets:
   - `blog_tester` (expected at src/bin/blog_tester.rs)
   - `blog_property_test` (at src/blog_property_test.rs)
   - `security_test` (at src/bin/security_test.rs)

3. **Incorrect Volume Mount**: The docker-compose.local.yml file was trying to mount a file called blog_tester.rs from the root directory, but this was actually an empty directory, not a file.

## Solution

### 1. Updated Dockerfile.local

Modified the pre-build step in Dockerfile.local to create placeholders for all three binary targets:

```dockerfile
# Pre-build dependencies (creates better Docker layer caching)
RUN mkdir -p src/bin && \
    echo "fn main() {}" > src/main.rs && \
    echo "fn main() { println!(\"Placeholder for blog_tester\"); }" > src/bin/blog_tester.rs && \
    echo "fn main() { println!(\"Placeholder for blog_property_test\"); }" > src/blog_property_test.rs && \
    echo "fn main() { println!(\"Placeholder for security_test\"); }" > src/bin/security_test.rs && \
    cargo build --release && \
    rm -rf src target/release/deps/cv*
```

This ensures that all binary targets have placeholder files during the pre-build step, allowing the cargo build command to succeed.

### 2. Fixed Volume Mount in docker-compose.local.yml

Removed the incorrect volume mount for blog_tester.rs:

```yaml
volumes:
  - blog-data:/app/data
  # Mount source code for hot reloading
  - ./src:/app/src
  - ./static:/app/static
  - ./templates:/app/templates
  - ./Cargo.toml:/app/Cargo.toml
  - ./Cargo.lock:/app/Cargo.lock
```

This is correct because the actual blog_tester.rs file is located at src/bin/blog_tester.rs, and since we're already mounting the entire src directory, there's no need for a separate mount for blog_tester.rs.

## Verification

The fix was verified by successfully running the deploy-local.sh script, which built the Docker image and started the application. The application is now accessible at the expected URLs:

- Homepage: http://localhost:3002
- Blog: http://localhost:3002/blog.html
- CV: http://localhost:3002/cv.html
- Projects: http://localhost:3002/projects.html

## Future Considerations

1. **Clean Up Root Directory**: Consider removing the empty blog_tester.rs directory from the root of the project to avoid confusion.

2. **Update Cargo.toml**: If the blog_tester binary is no longer needed, consider removing it from Cargo.toml.

3. **Standardize Binary Locations**: Consider standardizing the locations of binary targets in Cargo.toml to all be in src/bin/ for consistency.

4. **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance the deploy-local.sh script to provide more detailed error messages when the build fails, to make it easier to diagnose similar issues in the future.
