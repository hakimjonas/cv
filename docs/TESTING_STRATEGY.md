## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the CV and Blog application. It defines the approach, methodologies, tools, and best practices for ensuring the quality and reliability of the application through testing.

### Objectives

The primary objectives of this testing strategy are to:

1. Ensure the application functions correctly according to requirements
2. Identify and fix defects early in the development cycle
3. Maintain high code quality and prevent regressions
4. Validate performance, security, and usability
5. Provide confidence in the application's reliability
6. Support continuous integration and delivery

## Testing Approach

Our testing approach follows the testing pyramid model, which emphasizes a larger number of fast, focused unit tests, complemented by fewer integration tests and even fewer end-to-end tests.

### Testing Pyramid

```
    /\
   /  \
  /    \
 / E2E  \
/--------\
/          \
/ Integration \
/--------------\
/                \
/      Unit       \
/------------------\
```

- **Unit Tests**: Fast, focused tests that verify individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Tests that verify interactions between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Tests that verify the entire application flow from user perspective

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

For new features and significant changes, we recommend following a Test-Driven Development approach:

1. Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior
2. Implement the minimum code necessary to make the test pass
3. Refactor the code while ensuring tests continue to pass

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components in isolation, using mocks or stubs for dependencies.

**Current Implementation**:
- `blog_data_test.rs` - Tests for blog data models
- `blog_manager_test.rs` - Tests for blog manager (synchronous)
- `blog_manager_test_async.rs` - Tests for blog manager (asynchronous)
- `cv_data_test.rs` - Tests for CV data models
- `html_generator_test.rs` - Tests for HTML generator
- `typst_generator_test.rs` - Tests for Typst generator
- Tests in `unified_config.rs` - Tests for configuration

**Gaps to Address**:
- Increase coverage for utility functions
- Add tests for error handling scenarios
- Add tests for edge cases

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly.

**Current Implementation**:
- `blog_api_test.rs` - Tests for blog API
- `bin/test_blog_core.rs` - Tests for core blog functionality

**Gaps to Address**:
- Add tests for database migrations
- Add tests for API authentication (when implemented)
- Add tests for API rate limiting

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests verify the entire application flow from a user's perspective.

**Current Implementation**:
- Limited manual testing

**Gaps to Address**:
- Implement automated end-to-end tests using a tool like Cypress or Playwright
- Create test scenarios for common user workflows
- Test the application in a production-like environment

### Property-Based Tests

Property-based tests generate random inputs to verify that certain properties or invariants hold true.

**Current Implementation**:
- `blog_property_test.rs` - Property-based tests for blog data conversions

**Gaps to Address**:
- Expand property-based testing to other components
- Add more complex properties to test

### Security Tests

Security tests verify that the application is secure against common vulnerabilities.

**Current Implementation**:
- `bin/security_test.rs` - Tests for security features

**Gaps to Address**:
- Add tests for authentication and authorization
- Add tests for input validation and sanitization
- Add tests for secure data storage
- Implement regular security scanning

### Performance Tests

Performance tests verify that the application meets performance requirements.

**Current Implementation**:
- None

**Gaps to Address**:
- Implement load testing for API endpoints
- Implement stress testing for database operations
- Measure and monitor response times
- Establish performance baselines and thresholds

### Accessibility Tests

Accessibility tests verify that the application is usable by people with disabilities.

**Current Implementation**:
- None

**Gaps to Address**:
- Implement automated accessibility testing
- Conduct manual accessibility audits
- Ensure compliance with WCAG guidelines

## Test Coverage

Test coverage measures the extent to which the source code is tested. We aim for high test coverage, but prioritize meaningful tests over coverage for its own sake.

### Coverage Goals

- Unit Tests: 80% line coverage
- Integration Tests: Cover all API endpoints and critical paths
- End-to-End Tests: Cover all major user workflows

### Coverage Reporting

We will use cargo-tarpaulin to generate test coverage reports, which will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and published to a dashboard.

## Testing Tools

### Current Tools

- **Rust Test Framework**: Built-in testing framework for unit and integration tests
- **proptest**: Property-based testing library
- **tempfile**: Library for creating temporary files and directories for tests
- **tokio**: Async runtime for testing async code

### Additional Tools to Implement

- **cargo-tarpaulin**: Test coverage reporting
- **cargo-nextest**: Faster test runner with better reporting
- **Cypress/Playwright**: End-to-end testing
- **k6/Artillery**: Performance and load testing
- **OWASP ZAP**: Security testing
- **axe-core**: Accessibility testing

## CI/CD Integration

Tests should be fully integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that code changes are automatically tested before deployment.

### CI Pipeline

The CI pipeline should include the following test-related steps:

1. **Linting and Static Analysis**:
   - Run `cargo clippy` to check for code quality issues
   - Run `cargo fmt --check` to ensure code formatting standards

2. **Unit and Integration Tests**:
   - Run `cargo test` to execute all unit and integration tests
   - Run property-based tests

3. **Coverage Reporting**:
   - Generate test coverage reports using cargo-tarpaulin
   - Upload reports to a dashboard (e.g., Codecov)

4. **Security Scanning**:
   - Run security tests
   - Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities using cargo-audit

5. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Run end-to-end tests in a staging environment

### CD Pipeline

The CD pipeline should include additional test steps before deployment:

1. **Smoke Tests**:
   - Run basic tests to verify that the application is functioning
   - Check that critical endpoints are accessible

2. **Performance Tests**:
   - Run load tests to ensure the application can handle expected traffic
   - Verify that performance meets established thresholds

3. **Post-Deployment Tests**:
   - Run tests against the deployed application to verify successful deployment
   - Monitor for errors and performance issues

## Test Environment

### Local Development

Developers should be able to run tests locally during development:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific tests
cargo test blog_data

# Run tests with coverage
cargo tarpaulin

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### CI Environment

The CI environment should be as close as possible to the production environment to ensure accurate test results. It should include:

- Same operating system and dependencies as production
- Isolated database for testing
- Network access for external dependencies (with mocks where appropriate)
- Sufficient resources for performance testing

### Staging Environment

A staging environment should be maintained for end-to-end and performance testing before deployment to production. It should be a mirror of the production environment.

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Principles

1. **Isolation**: Tests should not depend on or affect each other's data
2. **Reproducibility**: Tests should produce the same results when run multiple times
3. **Realism**: Test data should be representative of real-world data
4. **Minimalism**: Use the minimum amount of data necessary for testing

### Test Data Strategies

1. **In-Memory Databases**: Use in-memory SQLite databases for unit and integration tests
2. **Test Fixtures**: Create reusable test fixtures for common test scenarios
3. **Factories**: Use factory functions to generate test data
4. **Seeding**: Seed the database with known data for end-to-end tests

## Reporting and Metrics

### Test Reports

Test reports should be generated for each test run and should include:

- Number of tests run, passed, failed, and skipped
- Test coverage metrics
- Performance metrics
- Time taken for each test and total test time

### Metrics to Track

1. **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
2. **Test Success Rate**: Percentage of tests that pass
3. **Test Duration**: Time taken to run tests
4. **Defect Density**: Number of defects found per unit of code
5. **Defect Escape Rate**: Percentage of defects that escape to production

### Dashboards

Create dashboards to visualize test metrics and trends over time. These dashboards should be accessible to all team members and stakeholders.

## Best Practices

### General Testing Principles

1. **Independence**: Tests should be independent of each other
2. **Repeatability**: Tests should produce the same results when run multiple times
3. **Self-Validation**: Tests should automatically determine if they pass or fail
4. **Thoroughness**: Tests should cover both normal and exceptional cases
5. **Maintainability**: Tests should be easy to understand and maintain

### Writing Effective Tests

1. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests with clear setup, action, and verification phases
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each test should verify a single behavior
3. **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
4. **Minimal Setup**: Keep test setup as simple as possible
5. **Fast Execution**: Tests should run quickly to provide rapid feedback

### Code Organization

1. **Test Location**: Place tests close to the code they test
2. **Test Structure**: Organize tests to mirror the structure of the code they test
3. **Shared Fixtures**: Extract common setup code into fixtures or helper functions
4. **Test Isolation**: Ensure tests don't depend on global state or other tests

## Maintenance and Evolution

### Test Maintenance

1. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and update tests as the codebase evolves
2. **Refactoring**: Refactor tests to improve clarity and maintainability
3. **Removing Obsolete Tests**: Remove tests that no longer provide value
4. **Updating Test Data**: Keep test data up to date with changes in requirements

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Retrospectives**: Conduct regular retrospectives to identify areas for improvement
2. **Learning from Failures**: Analyze test failures to improve test coverage
3. **Adopting New Tools**: Evaluate and adopt new testing tools and techniques
4. **Training**: Provide training on testing best practices
