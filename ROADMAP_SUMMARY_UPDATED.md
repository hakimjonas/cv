# Roadmap Summary (Updated)

This document provides a quick summary of the current state of the project and the next steps to be taken, based on the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) file.

## Current Status

The project has successfully completed several important milestones:

1. ✅ **Database Architecture Improvements**:
   - Implemented proper connection pooling
   - Created a migrations system for database schema
   - Implemented a repository layer for blog operations

2. ✅ **Logging Enhancements**:
   - Added proper logging with tracing throughout the codebase
   - Set up global subscribers for logging in main binary entry points
   - Implemented structured logging for errors

3. ✅ **Testing Improvements**:
   - Implemented property-based testing for the blog functionality
   - Created generators for BlogPost, Tag, and other data types
   - Added tests for serialization/deserialization roundtrips
   - Implemented tests for idempotency of operations

4. ✅ **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Implemented proper error types for blog operations
   - Replaced anyhow::Result with custom error types
   - Added comprehensive error conversion implementations
   - Ensured consistent use of Result monads throughout the codebase

5. ✅ **Functional Programming Transition**:
   - Ensured all data structures use `im` crate's immutable collections where appropriate
   - ✅ Refactored key methods in blog_data.rs to use functional approaches:
     - ✅ Refactored with_added_tag
     - ✅ Refactored with_removed_tag
     - ✅ Refactored with_added_metadata
     - ✅ Refactored with_removed_metadata
   - ✅ Refactored db/repository.rs to use functional approaches:
     - ✅ Refactored load_tags_for_post
     - ✅ Refactored load_metadata_for_post
     - ✅ Refactored get_all_posts
     - ✅ Refactored get_all_tags
   - ✅ Eliminated side effects in data processing functions in db/repository.rs

## Next Priorities

The following tasks should be prioritized next:

1. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - ✅ Implement proper error types instead of using `anyhow` everywhere
   - ✅ Use Result monads consistently throughout the codebase
   - Add proper error recovery mechanisms

2. **Improve Test Coverage**:
   - Add comprehensive integration tests
   - Implement proper mocks for external dependencies
   - Add tests for edge cases and error conditions

## Medium-Term Goals

1. Implement a proper CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
2. Move to a full-async SQLite implementation (sqlx or tokio-rusqlite)
3. Improve performance through caching and optimized database queries
4. Add metrics and monitoring for production deployments
5. Implement a comprehensive documentation system with examples

## Long-Term Vision

1. Implement a proper admin interface for the blog
2. Add support for more advanced blog features like comments and social sharing
3. Implement a proper theme system for the blog frontend
4. Explore alternative database backends (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
5. Implement a plugin system for extensibility

## Success Criteria Progress

- ✅ All tests pass consistently
- ✅ No database locking issues
- ✅ All operations are properly functional and immutable in blog_data.rs and db/repository.rs
- ⏳ Performance is improved (in progress)
- ⏳ Code is simpler and easier to understand (in progress)

## How to Contribute

If you're picking up work on this project, focus on the "Next Priorities" section first. While we've made significant progress on error handling and functional programming transition, adding proper error recovery mechanisms and improving test coverage are now the highest priorities to ensure the codebase remains robust and maintainable.
