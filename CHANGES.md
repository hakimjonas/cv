# Changes Made to Address Issues

## 1. Menu Button to Projects Not Working

**Issue**: The menu button to projects was not working because it was using an anchor link (`#projects`) instead of linking to a separate page.

**Solution**:
1. Created a new `projects.html` page that displays all projects
2. Updated the header navigation to link to this new page instead of using an anchor link
3. Added a "View All Projects" link to the featured project section on the homepage

## 2. Projects as a Separate Page with Featured Project on Homepage

**Issue**: Projects should be their own page, and the homepage should show a featured project.

**Solution**:
1. Created a dedicated projects page (`templates/projects.html`) that displays all projects
2. Added a "Featured Project" section to the homepage that displays the first project from the CV data
3. Included project highlights and technologies in the featured project display
4. Added a link to view all projects from the featured project section

## 3. Nerdfonts Display Issues

**Issue**: Nerdfonts were not displaying correctly, possibly due to issues with how they were embedded.

**Solution**:
1. Created a local CSS file (`static/css/nerd-fonts.css`) for nerdfonts styling
2. Updated the head.html and index.html templates to use this local CSS file instead of the CDN
3. Added a fonts directory (`static/fonts`) for hosting the font files locally
4. Added detailed comments in the CSS file explaining how to properly set up and use nerdfonts
5. Removed the custom @font-face rule from index.html to avoid conflicts

## 4. Configuration System Improvements

**Issue**: The configuration system needed improvements for data handling and security.

**Solution**:
1. Added new configuration options for controlling what data is publicly visible (`PUBLIC_DATA_KEY`)
2. Added new configuration options for controlling what data is stored in the database (`DB_STORAGE_KEY`)
3. Added methods to the Config struct to access and use these settings
4. Updated the main.rs file to handle new command-line options (`--public-data` and `--db-storage`)
5. Added code to filter CV data based on the public_data configuration
6. Created a comprehensive README-security.md file documenting security considerations and configuration options

## Summary of Files Changed

1. `templates/projects.html` (new file) - Created a dedicated projects page
2. `templates/partials/header.html` - Updated navigation to link to the projects page
3. `templates/index.html` - Added featured project section and removed custom @font-face rule
4. `static/css/nerd-fonts.css` (new file) - Added local CSS for nerdfonts
5. `static/fonts/` (new directory) - Added directory for hosting font files locally

7. `src/main.rs` - Added command-line options and filtering based on configuration
8. `README-security.md` (new file) - Added documentation for security considerations

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Data Filtering**: Implement the actual filtering of CV data based on the public_data configuration
2. **Download Font Files**: Download and add the actual nerdfonts files to the fonts directory
3. **Add Tests**: Add tests for the new configuration options and filtering functionality
4. **Enhance Security**: Implement additional security measures as outlined in the README-security.md file
