# About Me

I'm a passionate software engineer with expertise in functional programming, distributed systems, and cloud architecture.

## My Philosophy

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that follows functional programming principles. Immutable data structures, pure functions, and composability are at the core of my development approach.

## Experience Highlights

- **10+ years** of professional software development
- **Expert** in Rust, Scala, Python, and TypeScript
- **Deep knowledge** of distributed systems and cloud platforms
- **Strong advocate** for functional programming paradigms

## Current Focus

Currently, I'm focused on building high-performance, scalable systems using Rust and exploring the intersection of functional programming with modern cloud architectures.

## Open Source

I actively contribute to open source projects and maintain several libraries focused on functional programming utilities and developer tools.
