# Welcome to My Blog

Welcome to my new blog! This is where I'll share thoughts on software development, technology, and my journey as a developer.

## What You Can Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Rust Programming** - Tips, tricks, and lessons learned
- **Software Architecture** - Design patterns and best practices
- **Open Source Projects** - My contributions and discoveries
- **Developer Tools** - Workflow optimizations and tool reviews

## About This Blog

This blog is built with a custom static site generator written in Rust, integrated with my CV website. All posts are written in Markdown and version controlled alongside my code.

The entire system is designed around the developer workflow - write, commit, deploy.

## Stay Connected

Follow my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com).

Happy coding! ðŸ¦€
