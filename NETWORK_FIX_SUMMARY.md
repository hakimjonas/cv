# Docker Network Connectivity Fix - Summary

## Issue Fixed
Fixed the "Temporary failure resolving 'deb.debian.org'" error during Docker build by improving network resilience.

## Changes Made
1. **Dockerfile.local**: Removed direct modification of /etc/resolv.conf while keeping retry logic for apt-get commands
2. **docker-compose.local.yml**: Verified DNS settings at the service level
3. **Created rebuild-docker.sh**: Script to rebuild container with all improvements

## How to Use
1. Run the rebuild script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/rebuild-docker.sh
   ```

2. Check detailed documentation in `/docs/DOCKER_NETWORK_FIX.md`

These changes make your Docker build process more resilient to network issues.
