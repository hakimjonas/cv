# Issue Resolution

This document summarizes the issues that were identified and resolved in the CV and Blog application.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Main Website Not Found

**Issue:** The main website was not found, with a message suggesting to run `cargo run --bin cv` to generate the website files.

**Resolution:**
- Ran `cargo run --bin cv` to generate the website files
- Verified that the website files were created in the `dist` directory
- Confirmed that the main website (index.html) is now accessible

### 2. Blog API Tool Exception

**Issue:** When clicking the Create Post button in the blog client, a "ReferenceError: response is not defined" error was occurring.

**Root Cause:**
The blog client in the dist directory was loading the API client from an incorrect path (`/static/js/api-client.js` instead of `/dist/js/api-client.js`), which could cause inconsistencies or missing functionality.

**Resolution:**
- Located the JavaScript code that handles post creation in the blog client
- Examined the implementation of the `createPost` function and the API client
- Fixed the path to the API client in the dist/blog-client.html file to load from `/dist/js/api-client.js`
- Verified that the blog API tool now works without errors

### 3. Login Authentication Issue

**Issue:** Users were getting "Login failed: Invalid credentials" when trying to log in, and there were no default accounts available.

**Resolution:**
- Created a script (`src/bin/create_default_users.rs`) to create default user accounts
- Created comprehensive documentation on how to create and use the default accounts
- Fixed an issue in the script where `Database::new` was incorrectly awaited
- Successfully ran the script to create the default user accounts
- Verified that login now works with the default credentials

## Testing Instructions

### Testing the Main Website

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-local.sh start
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3002
   ```

3. Verify that the main website loads correctly

### Testing the Blog API Tool

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-local.sh start
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3002/static/blog-client.html
   ```

3. Click on the "Create Post" tab
4. Fill in the required fields
5. Click the "Create Post" button
6. Verify that the post is created without errors

### Testing Login Functionality

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-local.sh start
   ```

2. Create the default user accounts (if not already created):
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin create_default_users
   ```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3002/static/blog-client.html
   ```

4. Click the "Login" button or select the "Login" tab
5. Enter the credentials for one of the default users:
   - Admin: username=admin, password=admin123
   - Author: username=author, password=author123
   - Editor: username=editor, password=editor123
6. Click the "Login" button
7. Verify that you are successfully logged in

## Technical Details

### Default User Accounts

The default user accounts are created using the `UserRepository` in the application. The script is located at:
```
src/bin/create_default_users.rs
```

The script creates three default users with different roles:
- Admin user: Full access to all features
- Author user: Can create new posts and edit their own posts
- Editor user: Can edit existing posts but cannot create new ones

For more details, see the [DEFAULT_USERS.md](DEFAULT_USERS.md) documentation.

### API Client Path Fix

The blog client in the dist directory was loading the API client from an incorrect path. We fixed this by updating the script tag in `dist/blog-client.html`:

```html
<!-- Before -->
<script src="/static/js/api-client.js"></script>

<!-- After -->
<script src="/dist/js/api-client.js"></script>
```

This ensures that the blog client loads the correct version of the API client, which includes all the necessary functionality for authentication and post creation.

## Conclusion

All three issues have been successfully resolved:
1. The main website now loads correctly
2. The blog API tool works without errors
3. Login functionality works with the default credentials

These changes ensure that the application is fully functional and provides a good user experience.
