# Building a Functional Language in Rust

After years of working with Scala and functional programming paradigms, I decided to implement my own functional language using Rust. This post explores the journey, challenges, and insights gained from building a compiler from scratch.

## Why Build a Language?

Building a programming language is one of the most educational experiences a developer can undertake. It forces you to understand:

- **Lexical Analysis**: Breaking down source code into tokens
- **Parsing**: Building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- **Type Systems**: Implementing type checking and inference
- **Code Generation**: Translating high-level concepts to machine code

## The Stack

For this project, I chose:

- **Rust** for the compiler implementation
- **LLVM** for code generation
- **Property-based testing** with `proptest`
- **Immutable data structures** throughout

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Pure Functional Core

The language enforces immutability by default:

```rust
let x = 42
let y = x + 1  // Creates new value
x = 43         // Compile error!
```

### 2. Algebraic Data Types

Support for sum types and pattern matching:

```rust
type Option[A] = Some(A) | None

match value {
  Some(x) => println(x),
  None => println("No value")
}
```

### 3. Type Inference

Using Hindley-Milner type inference to minimize type annotations while maintaining type safety.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Error Recovery**: Building a parser that can provide helpful error messages
2. **Performance**: Balancing functional purity with runtime efficiency
3. **Interop**: Allowing interaction with existing Rust code

## Lessons Learned

Building a compiler taught me that:

- **Simplicity is key**: Start with a minimal feature set
- **Testing is crucial**: Property-based tests caught edge cases I never would have considered
- **Documentation matters**: Clear specs save development time

## What's Next?

The language is still evolving. Future plans include:

- Effect system for managing side effects
- Macro system for metaprogramming
- WebAssembly compilation target

## Conclusion

Building a functional language in Rust has been an incredible learning experience. It's deepened my understanding of both language design and the Rust ecosystem.
