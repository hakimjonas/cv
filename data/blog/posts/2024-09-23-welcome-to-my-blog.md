# Welcome to My Blog

This is the inaugural post of my new blog system, built with a unique Git-as-CMS approach that treats Git as the content database.

## How It Works

- **Blog posts** are markdown files in the `data/blog/posts/` directory
- **Commits** represent content changes (like database transactions)
- **Push to blog branch** triggers fast deployment (30 seconds)
- **Version control** gives us built-in backup and collaboration

## The Technical Stack

This blog is powered by:
- **Rust** for static site generation
- **Markdown** with YAML frontmatter for content
- **Askama** templating engine
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **GitHub Actions** for automated deployment

## Git-as-CMS Benefits

✅ **Version controlled** - every change is tracked
✅ **Collaborative** - multiple writers can contribute via Git
✅ **Fast deployments** - blog-only changes deploy in seconds
✅ **Developer-friendly** - uses familiar Git workflow
✅ **Free hosting** - GitHub Pages costs nothing

## What's Next

I'll be writing about:
- Rust development patterns
- Web development with modern tools
- Static site generation techniques
- Git workflows and automation

Stay tuned for more content!
