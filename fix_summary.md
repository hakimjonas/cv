# Fix Summary: deploy-local.sh Script Issues

## Issues Identified

1. **Build Context Issue**: In `docker-compose.local.yml`, the build context was set to the current directory (`.`), which became the `docker` directory when the script was run. The `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` files are in the project root, not in the `docker` directory.

2. **Path Resolution Issue**: The `deploy-local.sh` script was using relative paths (`../docker/docker-compose.local.yml`) which don't work correctly when the script is run from different directories.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed the Build Context in docker-compose.local.yml

```yaml
# Before
build:
  context: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile.local

# After
build:
  context: ..
  dockerfile: docker/Dockerfile.local
```

### 2. Made deploy-local.sh Location-Independent

Added code to determine the absolute path to the project root:
```bash
# Get the absolute path to the project root directory
PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"
DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE="${PROJECT_ROOT}/docker/docker-compose.local.yml"
```

Updated all Docker Compose commands to use the absolute path:
```bash
# Before
$DOCKER_COMPOSE -f ../docker/docker-compose.local.yml up -d --build --remove-orphans

# After
$DOCKER_COMPOSE -f "${DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE}" up -d --build --remove-orphans
```

## Testing Results

The changes successfully fixed the original file path issues. However, during testing, we encountered a new error related to the Cargo.toml configuration, which is a separate issue from the file path problems we were solving.

## Recommendations

1. Fix the Cargo.toml configuration issue in Dockerfile.local
2. Improve error handling in deploy-local.sh
3. Remove the obsolete `version` attribute from docker-compose.local.yml
