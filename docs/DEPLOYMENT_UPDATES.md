# Deployment Scripts Update Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the updates made to the deployment scripts in July 2025. The updates focus on improving the local development environment setup, modernizing Docker Compose usage, and enhancing error handling and user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `deploy-local.sh`

#### Modernization
- Added support for Docker Compose V2 (`docker compose`) with fallback to V1 (`docker-compose`)
- Updated command syntax to use the appropriate Docker Compose command based on the installed version

#### User Experience Improvements
- Added colored output for better readability
- Improved error messages and status information
- Enhanced progress reporting during startup
- Optimized waiting times for health checks

#### New Features
- Added `rebuild` command to rebuild the application from scratch while preserving data
- Added `prune` command to clean up unused Docker resources

#### Error Handling
- Improved error detection and reporting
- Added more descriptive error messages
- Enhanced cleanup on failure

### 2. Updated `docker-compose.local.yml`

- Added version specification (`3.8`)
- Added resource limits to prevent container from using too much CPU/memory
- Added logging configuration to limit log file size
- Added volume driver specification for better compatibility

### 3. Updated Dockerfiles

- Ensured consistency between `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.local` by using the same Rust version
- Added comments suggesting updating to the latest stable Rust version in the future

## Testing Instructions

To test the updated deployment scripts, follow these steps:

1. **Basic Functionality Test**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-local.sh start
   ```
   Verify that the application starts correctly and all services are healthy.

2. **Stop the Environment**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-local.sh stop
   ```
   Verify that all containers are stopped.

3. **Test Logs Command**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-local.sh start
   ./deploy-local.sh logs
   ```
   Verify that logs are displayed correctly.

4. **Test Status Command**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-local.sh status
   ```
   Verify that the status of all containers is displayed correctly.

5. **Test Rebuild Command**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-local.sh rebuild
   ```
   Verify that the application is rebuilt from scratch and starts correctly.

6. **Test Prune Command**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-local.sh stop
   ./deploy-local.sh prune
   ```
   Verify that unused Docker resources are cleaned up.

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Commands

- **Start the local development environment**
  ```bash
  ./deploy-local.sh start
  ```

- **Stop the local development environment**
  ```bash
  ./deploy-local.sh stop
  ```

- **Restart the local development environment**
  ```bash
  ./deploy-local.sh restart
  ```

- **Show logs from the containers**
  ```bash
  ./deploy-local.sh logs
  ```

- **Show the status of the containers**
  ```bash
  ./deploy-local.sh status
  ```

### Advanced Commands

- **Rebuild the application (preserves data)**
  ```bash
  ./deploy-local.sh rebuild
  ```
  This command stops the current containers, rebuilds the images without using cache, and restarts the application. Data in volumes is preserved.

- **Remove unused Docker resources**
  ```bash
  ./deploy-local.sh prune
  ```
  This command removes all unused containers, networks, images, and volumes. It will prompt for confirmation before proceeding.

- **Show help**
  ```bash
  ./deploy-local.sh help
  ```
  This command displays usage information and available commands.

## Accessing the Application

Once the local development environment is running, you can access the application at the following URLs:

- **Main Website:**
  - Homepage: http://localhost:3002
  - Blog: http://localhost:3002/blog.html
  - CV: http://localhost:3002/cv.html
  - Projects: http://localhost:3002/projects.html

- **Development Tools:**
  - Blog API: http://localhost:3002/api/blog
  - API Admin: http://localhost:3002/admin
  - Blog Client: http://localhost:3002/static/blog-client.html
  - Debug Tool: http://localhost:3002/static/blog-debug.html

## Future Improvements

Consider the following improvements for future updates:

1. Update to the latest stable Rust version
2. Implement automated testing for deployment scripts
3. Add support for different environments (development, staging, production)
4. Enhance security with secrets management
5. Implement CI/CD integration

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the deployment scripts, try the following:

1. **Container fails to start**
   - Check the logs: `./deploy-local.sh logs`
   - Verify Docker is running: `docker info`
   - Check for port conflicts: `netstat -tuln | grep 3002`

2. **Application is not accessible**
   - Check container status: `./deploy-local.sh status`
   - Verify the container is healthy: `docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' $(docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml ps -q blog-api)`
   - Check application logs: `./deploy-local.sh logs`

3. **Rebuild fails**
   - Try pruning unused resources: `./deploy-local.sh prune`
   - Check disk space: `df -h`
   - Verify Docker daemon is running correctly: `docker info`
