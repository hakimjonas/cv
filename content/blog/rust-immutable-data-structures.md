# Immutable Data Structures in Rust: A Deep Dive

Rust's ownership system provides memory safety, but working with immutable data structures can take your code to the next level of correctness and maintainability.

## Why Immutable Data Structures?

Traditional mutable data structures can lead to:

- **Race conditions** in concurrent code
- **Unexpected mutations** from shared references
- **Complex debugging** when state changes unpredictably

## The `im` Crate

The `im` crate provides persistent immutable data structures for Rust:

```rust
use im::{Vector, HashMap};

let mut vec = Vector::new();
vec.push_back(1);
let vec2 = vec.clone(); // Cheap O(1) clone
vec.push_back(2);
// vec2 still contains only [1]
```

## Performance Characteristics

Persistent data structures use structural sharing:

| Operation | Mutable Vec | im::Vector |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Push      | O(1)*       | O(log n)   |
| Clone     | O(n)        | O(1)       |
| Access    | O(1)        | O(log n)   |

*Amortized

## Real-World Use Case

In my CV generator project, using immutable data structures simplified state management:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct AppState {
    cv: im::Vector<Section>,
    config: im::HashMap<String, Value>,
}

impl AppState {
    fn add_section(&self, section: Section) -> Self {
        let mut new_state = self.clone(); // Cheap!
        new_state.cv.push_back(section);
        new_state
    }
}
```

## Benefits in Practice

1. **Thread Safety**: Share data between threads without locks
2. **Undo/Redo**: Keep history of states efficiently
3. **Debugging**: State never changes unexpectedly
4. **Testing**: Predictable behavior makes tests simpler

## When to Use Mutable vs Immutable

Use **mutable** when:
- Performance is critical
- Working with large datasets
- Local, single-threaded context

Use **immutable** when:
- Sharing data between threads
- Building event-sourced systems
- Implementing undo/redo
- Working with functional patterns

## Conclusion

Immutable data structures in Rust provide a powerful tool for building robust, concurrent applications. While they come with some performance overhead, the benefits in code clarity and correctness often outweigh the costs.
