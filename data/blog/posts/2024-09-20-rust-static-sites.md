# Building Static Sites with Rust

While many developers reach for JavaScript-based tools like Gatsby or Next.js for static site generation, Rust offers compelling advantages for this use case.

## Why Rust for Static Sites?

### Type Safety
With Rust's strong type system, you can catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. This is especially valuable when processing structured data like frontmatter or JSON configurations.

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct BlogPost {
    title: String,
    date: NaiveDate,
    tags: Vec<String>,
    published: bool,
}
```

### Performance
Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory efficiency make build times fast, even for large sites with hundreds of posts.

### Ecosystem
Crates like `serde` for JSON processing and `askama` for templating provide excellent building blocks.

## Template Integration

Using Askama, you can create type-safe templates:

```rust
#[derive(Template)]
#[template(path = "blog_post.html")]
struct BlogPostTemplate {
    post: BlogPost,
    related_posts: Vec<BlogPost>,
}
```

## Deployment

The beauty of static sites is deployment simplicity - just upload the generated HTML/CSS/JS to any web server or CDN.

For personal projects, GitHub Pages offers free hosting that integrates perfectly with your development workflow.

## Conclusion

Rust brings reliability and performance to static site generation while maintaining the simplicity that makes static sites attractive in the first place.
