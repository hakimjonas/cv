# Changes to Credentials Module

## Issue

There was a compilation error in the `credentials.rs` file:

```
error[E0277]: `std::result::Result<std::string::String, std::io::Error>` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`
   --> src/credentials.rs:349:47
    |
349 |     let combined = format!("{}:{}", hostname, username);
    |                                               ^^^^^^^^ `std::result::Result<std::string::String, std::io::Error>` cannot be formatted with the default formatter
```

The error occurred because `whoami::username()` in version 2.0.0-pre.2 returns a `Result<String, std::io::Error>` rather than a `String` directly. This result was being used in a string format without being properly handled.

## Solution

The issue was fixed by properly handling the `Result` returned by `whoami::username()`:

```rust
// Before:
let username = whoami::username();

// After:
let username = whoami::username().unwrap_or_else(|_| "unknown_user".to_string());
```

This change unwraps the `Result` to get the username string, or provides a fallback value of "unknown_user" if there's an error. This ensures that `username` is always a `String` rather than a `Result<String, std::io::Error>`, which allows it to be used in the string format.

## Additional Context

The `get_machine_key()` function is used to derive a machine-specific key for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data like API tokens. It combines the hostname and username to create a unique key for the current machine.

This change ensures that the function continues to work even if there's an error getting the username, which could happen in certain environments or with certain system configurations.
